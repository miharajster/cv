### Personal projects

Biggest Minecraft community at the time, with thousands of users. Hold together with Debian Linux (as a MC server), Wordpress (as a blog platform), forum, a LOT of custom PHP APIs and one Android app built for users. Everything was made and administered by me.

#### BOTs House
